## Program link
You can get FFmpeg from `ffmpeg.org`.

## More descriptions
The `mkv` versions of scripts can correctly store downloaded video data even the scripts are interrupted. You can convert it into `mp4` easily using tools. (Recompiling not required; You can use tools like in OBS to convert.)  
The `mp4` versions of scripts cannot be interrupted (like `Ctrl+C` or network being disconnected), or the downloaded files can neither be opened by video players, nor be fixed by FFmpeg. (I do not know if there are other tools to fix corrupted files.)

## Known issues
The scripts cannot realize the function of continuing to download.  
If you have better ideas, please do not hesitate to inform me!
